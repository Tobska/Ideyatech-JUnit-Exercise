Unit Testing
-process in w/c classes are scrutinized for proper orientation

Code coverage
-percentage of code being tested
-80% is already acceptable (logic part only, not including imports and if-else statements)


-highly coupled, loosely coupled
remember cohesion and coupling

//assertEquals uses the equals() function of the given class
//assertSame checks the memory used to compare the two objects
